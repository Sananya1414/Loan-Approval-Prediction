# Loan Approval Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict loan approval using various machine learning algorithms. 
It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building to create a robust predictive model.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Data Preprocessing
1. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values are imputed using appropriate techniques like mean, median, or mode for numerical variables and the most frequent value for categorical variables.
2. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Categorical variables are encoded using one-hot encoding or label encoding to convert them into numerical format.
3. **Normalizing Numerical Features**: Numerical features are normalized to ensure they are on a similar scale, which helps improve model performance.

## Feature Engineering
New features are created from existing ones to capture additional information and improve the model's predictive power. For example, combining related features or creating interaction terms.

## Model Building
Several machine learning algorithms are implemented, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

## Evaluation Metrics
Models are evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

## Results
The performance of different models is compared, and the best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics. Visualizations are used to understand the data distribution and model performance.
